BookMatch
Do you ever feel frustrated trying to find the right book? We understand you, and are here with a solution. BookMatch is a platform that allows users to discover new books based on their preferences.

What it does
The website has a chatbot that provides personalized book recommendations based on user input. Users can input a specific genre, or author and the chatbot will suggest unique book reccomendations based on the user's interests.

How we built it
"text-davinci-003" model: This model was used for language processing and generating human-like responses for the chatbot. HTML: This was used for the structure and content of the web pages. CSS: This was used for styling the web pages. JavaScript: This was used for creating the interactive elements of the web pages, such as the chatbot.

Challenges we ran into and What we Learned
We had never implemented a chatbot into a website before today, so it was interesting trying out different strategies to ensure that the chatbot was accurately recommending novels based off of user inputs and interests.

We also never interact with the "text-davinci-003" model - in general before this weekend, so it was interesting to learn more about this novel and practice its implementation within our project.

Accomplishments
In the end, this project allowed us to practice our web development skills through the use of HTML and CSS to properly style a landing page. In addition, this project allowed us the opportunity to practice using Javascript to properly integrate a chatbot for our website.

The Future of BookMatch
There are many avenues where we could take this project in the future. We would love to add a rating system in the future, as well as user profiles/authentication. Users would be able to log in to the website, have their own profiles as well as their own bookshelfs, and eventually be able to rate the books that they read that were suggested through BookMatch! There are many avenues where we could take this project - and it will be exciting to implement additional features in the feature!
