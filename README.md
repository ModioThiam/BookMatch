BookMatch
Welcome to BookMatch! Do you ever feel frustrated trying to find the right book? We understand you, and are here with a solution. BookMatch is a platform that allows users to discover new books based on their preferences. The website has a chatbot that provides personalized book recommendations based on user input. Users can input a specific genre, author, or book title, and the chatbot will suggest books based on their interests.

Technology Used
BookMatch was created using the following technologies:

- "text-davinci-003" model: This model was used for language processing and generating human-like responses for the chatbot.
- HTML: This was used for the structure and content of the web pages.
- CSS: This was used for styling the web pages.
- JavaScript: This was used for creating the interactive elements of the web pages, such as the chatbot.
